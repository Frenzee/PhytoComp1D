# PhytoComp1D
Vertically resolved reaction-advection-diffusion model of phytoplankton competition

This is an implementation of the commonly used 1D integro-PDE model of phytoplankton light and nutrient competition. This code is implemented using the Sundials package. I am placing this code here in the interests of open code development in scientific research. The code is poorly documented and could be improved in a myriad of ways. I intend to document any changes I make here and will endevour to improve the commenting and design of the code. Hopefully having anyone being able to see my embaressing code will inspire me to actually do all of this.
